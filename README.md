kobudo-katas
============

“Okinawan kobudō refers to the weapon systems of Okinawan martial arts” (from Wikipedia)

Kodudo Katas are classic software katas with a twist.  You practice good programming techniques and new ideas but you use your warrior weapons tool!

A kobudo kata uses to involve a web server, or an API rest or any repository like a relational database or MogoDB for example. You try to create a good, decoupled design but taking into account the interactions with the external world.

This kind of katas forces a global vision, not only a vision from the model domain. They encourage flexible tools and lightweight-frameworks hat allows you to create pure models, instead of framework that forces you to write you domain logic inside them.
