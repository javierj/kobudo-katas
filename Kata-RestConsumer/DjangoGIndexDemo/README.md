Django - GIndex demo
=================

This is a very simple Django application (mi first one ever) that uses the GIndex code from the kobudo kata RestConsumer. Kata's result code has been used without changing any line

This application is an example of how a good design may allow us to decouple technical issues, interfaces and delaying technical decisions.
